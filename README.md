# This project is focus on:
i.Naive Bayes technique 
	This technique is chosen because it is a high bias, low variance classifier. It is also fast and is able to work on just a small dataset as it does not require much training data.



ii.Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) technique
This technique is chosen because it has high effectiveness in high dimensional spaces. SVC is also more memory efficient and works well when there is a relatively clear margin between two spaces.




iii.Logistic Regression technique
This technique is implemented because it is straight forward and naturally flexible. It also can be regularized to reduce over-fitting.
